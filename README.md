# Customer-Behavior-Analysis-
Key Findings:
**Gender Neutrality in Churn Rate**: Our data indicates that both genders behave in a similar fashion when it comes to migrating to another service provider or firm. Gender does not seem to be a significant factor influencing churn.
**Contract Type Impact**: Approximately 88.5% of customers with a Month-to-Month Contract opted to move out, compared to 8.8% of customers with a One-Year Contract and 2.5% with a Two-Year Contract. We need to explore strategies to encourage longer-term contracts to reduce churn.
**Payment Method**: A significant number of customers who moved out were using Electronic Check as their payment method. In contrast, customers who opted for Credit-Card automatic transfer, Bank Automatic Transfer, or Mailed Check were less likely to churn. We should investigate the reasons behind this payment method's impact on churn and consider alternatives.
**Fiber Optic Service**: Many customers choose Fiber optic service, but it's evident that customers using Fiber optic have a high churn rate. This suggests potential dissatisfaction with this service. We should assess and address the reasons for this dissatisfaction.
**Dependents and Partners**: Customers without dependents and without partners are more likely to churn. We may need to tailor our services or promotions to these segments to improve retention.
**Senior Citizens**: The fraction of senior citizens is quite small, and most of them churn. Understanding their specific needs and concerns can help us retain this demographic.
**Online Security**: The majority of customers churn when there is an absence of online security. We should prioritize enhancing our online security features to boost customer confidence.
**Paperless Billing**: Customers who opt for paperless billing are more likely to churn. We should investigate the reasons behind this trend and consider changes to our billing processes.
**Tech Support**: Customers with no tech support are more likely to migrate to another service provider. We need to improve our tech support offerings to address this concern.
**Phone Service**: A small fraction of customers doesn't have phone service, and one-third of them are more likely to churn. We should explore options to make our phone service more attractive to this segment.
**Monthly Charges**: Customers with higher monthly charges are also more likely to churn. We need to offer competitive pricing options and better value for our services.
**New Customers**: New customers are more likely to churn. We should focus on onboarding and initial experiences to improve retention.

**Recommendations**:
•	Review and enhance contract options to incentivize longer-term commitments.
•	Investigate and address the dissatisfaction among Fiber optic users.
•	Tailor communication and services to customers without dependents and partners.
•	Prioritize online security improvements.
•	Explore options to make phone service more appealing.
•	Focus on creating a positive onboarding experience for new customers
